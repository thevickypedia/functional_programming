# Functional Programming

This program provides a basic understanding of how multithreading and multiprocessing works in python.

#### Code Explanation: 
Comparison between ThreadPoolExecutor, Multiprocessing and Multithreading. All three the functions are set to run 
with number of cpu cores in a machine and dummy loop through 50 million times. 
You can also alter these to run with any numbers.


The whole point of this project is to explain how different functional programming concepts work. The intention is 
not to prove one over the other as that depends on various various other factors. Most concepts here are extremely 
useful for web crawling and I/O handling applications.
